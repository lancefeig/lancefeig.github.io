## Velcro Summer 2022 - Python Self-Assembling SolidWorks Container

### [GitHub Repositiory](https://github.com/lancefeig/velcro-self-assembling-container) - [README](https://github.com/lancefeig/velcro-self-assembling-container/blob/main/README.md) - [SelfAssemblingContainer.py](https://github.com/lancefeig/velcro-self-assembling-container/blob/main/SelfAssemblingContainer.py)

Self-Assembling Container is a Python script that calculates and edits dimensions in SolidWorks files to create containers for testing lab equipment at Velcro Research & Development.

The goal is to reduce the time spent modeling and designing by cutting out repetitive calculations.

The program receives numerical input from a Tkinter GUI and modifies SolidWorks part file templates by rewriting 
externally referenced equation .txt files. It utilizes OS and Shutil modules to generate an instance folder, containing an acrylic laser SolidWorks cutting layout assembly and container build assembly.

## Velcro Summer 2022 - SolidWorks Renderings for Testing Lab Fixture Containers

During my Summer 2022 internship at Velcro in Manchester, New Hampshire, one of my projects was to design storage containers for different equipment in the R&D testing lab.

Each fixture was a combination of heavy, weirdly shaped, super tiny, or prone to falling over. I designed unique containers to house each fixture from scratch. Container pieces (sides, base, and lid) were fashioned from acrylic sheets, which I cut using the in-house CO2 laser cutter.

All 11 containers were fully modeled in SolidWorks, including 3D printed pieces and necessary hardware.
